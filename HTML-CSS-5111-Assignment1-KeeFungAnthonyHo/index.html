        The season finale really fleshes out the relationship development
        between Takina Inoue and Chisato Nishikigi. Episode 13 starts off with
        Chisato locked on the top floor of the Old Radio Tower as the
        electricity is cut off. Without electricity, visuals from CCTV footage
        of what is happening inside the tower is completely cut off.
        Furthermore, the elevators abruptly stop working. Fuki and her squad are
        forced to contemplate their next move.
        </p>

        <p>
        The DA orders Fuki Harukawa to bring the wounded Sakura Otome down and
        allow Chisato to handle Majima. The squad, knowing that Chisato's
        mechanical heart is failing her, objects. However, the DA clarifies that
        it was a direct order - to retreat and let Chisato handle it. Fuki is
        conflicted as she wants to assist Chisato in dealing with Majima. In the
        end, Fuki and the newly re-initiated Takina (who was kicked out of the
        DA since the <a href="#">first episode</a>) devises a plan whereby Takina disobeys a
        superior's order once again to ensure that both objectives are tackled.
        </p>

        <p>
        "I am the only one that can save Chisato, and you are the only one that
        can save Sakura," Takina says to Fuki. The two agree and split off. With
        the DA Lycoris in full retreat, Chisato confonts Majima one last time.
        Takina scales the Old Radio Tower via their maintenance ladders and
        platforms, rushing to aid her partner.

        There is a pause in the showdown between Chisato and Majima. Her heart appears to begin to fail, as she exerts more and more energy.
        Majima notices this and takes a break with Chisato. The two exchange dialogue regarding what they are both fighitng for.
        Chisato maintains that she is fighting for peace. Majima explains he is fighitng for the People/populace (the weaker side) against the DA because the DA is destroying the natural balance - 
        had the DA been the weaker side, Majima said he would be standing on their side. Chisato sighs in defeat, commenting that even he, Majima, thinks he is right. "I guess the only villains are those in the silver screens," Chisato
        says in a disappointed yet confused voice.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Chisato begins to list the things she is grateful for - be it the morning before the city becomes bustling,
        the nature, the people, the food - but most importantly, are her Teacher, café friends, and Takina. Majima scoffs at her, cricitizing her for not being ambitious and
        having no dreams. Chisato's philosophy, as she explains, is that helping those people in need is a way of continuing on in their memories. Majima laughs
        and says that it is ironic, as he is the last client of hers. Chisato agrees. Before the two begin their showdown, Majima preludes the re-engagement by 
        asking: "Who will be the hero of justice? The one fighting for the balance of Japan or the one maintaining the status-quo?"
