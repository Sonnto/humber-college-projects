      <p class="articlePara">
        The season finale really fleshes out the relationship development
        between Takina and Chisato. Episode 13 starts off with Chisato locked on
        the top floor of the Old Radio Tower as the electricity is cut off.
        Without electricity, visuals from CCTV footage of what is happening
        inside the tower is completely cut off. Furthermore, the elevators
        abruptly stop working.
      </p>

      <p class="articlePara">
        Fuki and her squad are forced to contemplate their next move. The DA
        orders Fuki to bring the wounded Sakura down and allow Chisato to handle
        Majima. The squad, knowing that Chisato's mechanical heart is failing
        her, objects. However, the DA clarifies that it was a direct order - to
        retreat and let Chisato handle it. Fuki and the newly re-initiated
        Takina, who was kicked out of the DA since the first episode, devises a
        plan whereby Takina disobeys orders once again. "I am the only one that
        can save Chisato, and you are the only one that can save Sakura,""
        Takina says to Fuki.
      </p>

      <p class="articlePara">
        The two agree and split off. With the DA Lycoris in full retreat,
        Chisato confonts Majima one last time. Takina scales the Old Radio Tower
        via their maintenance ladders and platforms, rushing to aid her best
        friend.
